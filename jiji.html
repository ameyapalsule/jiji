			<div class='poem'> <h1>To Jiji with Love</h1>
					<p>Dada and Jiji as grandparents was the best gift that we received,</p>
					<p>Their life was full of loving deeds, thoughtful and caring for others need.</p>
					<p>Together they were like rum and coke, a combination which never broke.</p>
					<p>Jiji was full of vigor, charm and pride, when she had babu by her side,</p>
					<p>Dada was calm and peaceful at mind, seeing Vilas and Suresh being Elon Musk of their time,</p>
					<p>Shobha has always been the apple of an eye, a caring daughter who always stood by,</p>
					<p>Like mother, the daughter has a spark, a true artist and painter at heart.</p>
					<p>Jiji was known for her saris, a woman with poise and a refined choice.</p>
					<p>Matter ki kachori, pattal bhaji or thalipit night, she always got every ingredient right.</p>
					<p>Her love was truly unconditional even when I took away her tea-sweetener.</p>
					<p>We had our shared interests, I offered her Parle-G for keeping my secrets.</p>
					<p>Now that we have grown old and have tablets and medicines of our own,</p> 
					<p>The extra dosage of Vicco and Move, is now far better understood.</p>
					<p>I am sure you are happy, now you have great grand kids who are extremely charming and peppy.</p>
					<p>Wherever in this world your spirit may roam, our heart will always be your home.</p></br>
